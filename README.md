# Handwritten-Digit-Synthesizer-with-DCGAN
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images resembling the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The model consists of a Generator, which creates fake images from random noise, and a Discriminator, which distinguishes real images from fakes. Both models are trained adversarialy: the Generator improves by learning to fool the Discriminator, while the Discriminator enhances its ability to differentiate real from fake images. The training process involves iterative gradient updates, with checkpoints for saving progress and a visualization pipeline to monitor results at each epoch. Over time, the generated images evolve from random noise to realistic digits, demonstrating the Generator's learning progress. The results are compiled into an animation to showcase training evolution effectively.
